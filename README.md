You can load the model weights into the C3D_model.py for testing.

## Datasets
In order to protect the privacy of participants in the AVEC 13 and 14 datasets, we are unable to provide the datasets. For specific data partitioning protocols, please refer to the following papers:"Avec 2013: the continuous audio/visual emotion and depression recognition challenge" and  "Avec 2014: 3d dimensional affect and depression recognition challenge". 

## Others
Other files will be updated later.
